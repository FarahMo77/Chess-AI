*Overview* :raised_hands:

This project implements a chess game using artificial intelligence in Python. 
The game allows users to play against an AI opponent, which uses algorithms to make strategic decisions. 
The goal is to create an engaging chess experience while demonstrating the capabilities of AI in game development.

*Features* :computer:

Single Player Mode: Play against an AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels.

Move Validation: Ensure that all moves adhere to the rules of chess.

AI Algorithms: Implement basic AI strategies using algorithms such as Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning for improved decision-making.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): A simple yet intuitive interface to visualize the chessboard and pieces.
